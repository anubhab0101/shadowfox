3.Embark on an AIdriven journey in the realm of natural language
processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) by deploying a Language
Model (LM) of your choice. In this project, you are tasked with delving
into the intricacies of LM technology, where the selection of the LM is
entirely at your discretion. The comprehensive process involves not only
implementing the chosen LM but also conducting an indepth analysis of
its performance and capabilities.
Guidelines:
1. LM Selection: Choose an LM that aligns with your interests, whether
it be cuttingedge models like GPT3, BERT, or even a specialized
domainspecific LM. The selection should be driven by your curiosity
and the specific context in which the LM will be applied.
2. Implementation in a Jupyter Notebook: Create a Jupyter notebook
from scratch to implement and showcase the chosen LM. Provide a
stepbystep demonstration of the implementation process, highlighting
key features, parameters, and any unique aspects of the selected LM.
3. Exploration and Analysis: Conduct a thorough exploration of the
LM's capabilities within the Jupyter notebook. Analyze its performance
on sample text inputs, showcase its ability to understand context, and
evaluate its language generation capabilities. This phase may involve
experimenting with different input scenarios and documenting the LM's
responses.
4. Research Questions and Objectives: Based on your exploration, define
research questions that delve into the strengths and limitations of the
chosen LM. Consider aspects such as contextual understanding,
creativity in generating text, and adaptability to diverse domains. Tailor
your research questions to extract meaningful insights from the LM's
behavior.
Task 3(Advanced Level): Continued...
5. Visualization of Results: Utilize visualization techniques to present the
results of your LM analysis. This could involve graphical
representations of the LM's responses, comparisons with baseline
models, or even visualizing the attention mechanisms within the LM
architecture. Visualization aids in conveying complex information in an
accessible manner.
6. Project Alignment and Evaluation: Align your project with the
overarching goals of advancing understanding in the field of NLP and
ML. Ensure that your work aligns with best practices, ethical
considerations, and the evolving landscape of LM technology.
Regularly refer to the project description and grading rubric to meet the
specified requirements and expectations.
7. Conclusion and Insights: Summarize your findings, draw insightful
conclusions from the LM analysis, and discuss potential applications or
areas for improvement. Reflect on the broader implications of your
work within the context of the rapidly evolving field of AI and LM
technologies. By the conclusion of this project, you should have not only
implemented an LM of your choice but also conducted a robust
analysis, showcasing your ability to navigate and leverage advanced AI
models for language processing tasks.
