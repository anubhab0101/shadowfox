# Write a function that takes two arguments, 145 and 'o', anduses the `format` function to return a formatted string. Print the result. Try to identify the representation used.

# def format_number(num, fmt):
#     result = format(num, fmt)
#     print(result)
#     return result
# format_number(145, 'o')  #Output:221

# In a village, there is a circular pond with a radius of 84 meters. Calculate the area of the pond using the formula: 
# Circle Area = πr^2. (Use the value 3.14 for π) Bonus Question: If there is exactly 1.4 liters of water in a square meter, 
# what is the total amount of water in the pond? Print the answer without any decimal point in it. Hint: Circle 
# Area = π r^2 Water in the pond = Pond Area Water per Square Meter.

# radius = 84
# pi = 3.14
# area = pi * radius ** 2
# water_per_sqm = 1.4
# total_water = area * water_per_sqm
# print(int(total_water))

# If you cross a 490 meterlong street in 7 minutes, calculate your speed in meters per second. Print the answer 
# without any decimal point in it. Hint: Speed = Distance / Time

# distance = 490
# time_minutes = 7
# time_seconds = time_minutes * 60
# speed = distance / time_seconds
# print(int(speed))
